Code realised for a technical test for WorkIT Software

It copies the input file into a output.txt file and doesn't copy any word that matches one of those passed in parameter.

The parameters are sent directly to the main method, the first one being the name of the input file,
and the others ones being the words to be filtered.

This code has been developped on Eclipse. It can be run by importing it as a maven project, setting the parameters in the run configuration in arguments,
and running it as a Java Application.
